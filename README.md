## Why?
Because Neptun SUCKS. It's like going back to the '80s

## Installation steps
Until the extension is stable enough to be pushed up to Chrome Web Store, here are the manual steps for installation and debugging:

  1. Run `git clone https://github.com/noxowe/NeptunFTW.git NeptunFTW`
  2. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox. The menu's icon is three horizontal bars. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
  3. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
  4. Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.
  5. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.
  6. Open up Neptun to test if everything is working
